\section{Conclusion}
We implemented Athernet using rust programing language, making it easy to be moved to other platforms and has significant efficiency. The Athernet has been tested on GNU/Linux and macOS, and it is effortless to deploy on both systems. Overall, our work powerfully demonstrates the feasibility of acoustic networks. Athernet is a promising alternative data communication method that could have a wide range of applications. Further research could be carried out to improve the system's performance and to explore other potential applications.
